# HomeTurf Android Library App

Contains the HomeTurf Android library and releases (available for easy integration via JitPack.io).

## Dependencies

- Gradle Project Version: `>=4.1.2`
- Gradle Wrapper Version: `>=6.7.1`
- Auth0 (optional)

## Setup and Run

- Open your project in Android Studio
- Sync dependencies when changing build.gradle files (adding/modifying dependencies)
- Update the team values in the app `res/values/strings.xml` resource file if/as needed

## Integration

Add JitPack to your build.gradle with:

```gradle
allprojects {
    repositories {
        maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
    }
}
```

and:

```gradle
dependencies {
    compile 'com.hometurf.android:{latest version}'
}
```

## Multiple build variants

If your library uses multiple flavours then see this example:
https://github.com/jitpack-io/android-jitpack-library-example

## Adding the maven plugin

To enable installing into local maven repository and JitPack you need to add the [android-maven](https://github.com/dcendents/android-maven-gradle-plugin) plugin:

1. Add `classpath 'com.github.dcendents:android-maven-gradle-plugin:2.1'` to root build.gradle under `buildscript { dependencies {`
2. Add `com.github.dcendents.android-maven` to the library/build.gradle

After these changes you should be able to run:

    ./gradlew install
    
from the root of your project. If install works and you have added a GitHub release it should work on jitpack.io

## Adding a sample app 

If you add a sample app to the same repo then your app needs to have a dependency on the library. To do this in your app/build.gradle add:

```gradle
    dependencies {
        compile project(':library')
    }
```
